#  this is replacing the function of Make
#  With the speed of today's compilers, the optimization
#  of avoiding recompile of the code is of little value
#  and the added flexibility of a script is of
#  significant value
# the build is currently targeted to 3 platforms
#  Darwin - mac osx
#  Linux  - various forms of linux
#  Mingw  - Mingw 32 on Windows
#
#  it will use different environments based upon access
#  to the libraries supplied by installing qOp from Dwave
#
#  if the libraries are present links will be made to those
#   libraries via a link
#  if the libraries are not present
#   a file with stubs to those called routines will be
#   supplied as part of the compile and link
#  the libraries will be assumed to exist if $DWAVE_HOME
#   is defined, if it is defined, and libraries don't exist
#   this will likely fail
#
